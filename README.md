This replication study involves the application of advanced econometric techniques, including difference-in-differences (Diff-in-Diff) analysis, Survival Analysis, and the Proportional Hazard Model, to investigate the effects of various financial incentives on the duration of unemployment. By leveraging comprehensive economic data from Austria, the study meticulously replicates and builds upon the findings of Lalive et al. (2006). The objective is to validate their results and provide insights into how changes in unemployment policies and other financial incentives influence unemployment durations. This study confirms the robustness of the original findings.
